# SQL_Investigative-_Analysis
## Project Overview
This project is a data-driven investigative analysis of a documented case involving the murder of Roland Greene, a well-known art collector, who was found dead in his private estate. Using SQL, timelines, and structured reports, the goal is to identify inconsistencies, verify statements, and highlight key findings from the available data.
